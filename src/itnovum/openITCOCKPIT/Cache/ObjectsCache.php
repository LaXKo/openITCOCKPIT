/**
 * PHP passes objects by reference, instead of copy-on-write.
 * This means that we can pass an instance of this object to a function, and the function
 * can write directly into this object.
 *
 * Would we pass a simple array parameter, and we change the data in the array, php would need to create a copy of the array
 * (copy-on-write).
 * If we do not change the array and only read from it, this is not requered as php only has to copy the variable if we modify it.
 * Alternative we could pass the variable as reference (&cache)
 *
 * See this example code: https://gist.github.com/nook24/77781fea5b6959ecfc7fb1caaa7d67eb
 *
 * ---
 * This is more or less the same as \itnovum\openITCOCKPIT\Core\KeyValueStore,
 * but it can hold multiple type of objects.
 * This class gt build to speed up the Changelog of openITCOCKPIT.
